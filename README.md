## Installation of python enviroment
One of the following ways can be used to get the enviroment up and running:
### If python exist on computer.
The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks
depend on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### If anaconda exist on computer
```
conda create -n RVpython368 python=3.6.8
conda activate RVpython368

```
### If you don't have python 
#### Windows
Download the excecutable installer file from
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/
C:\Users\sjohanss\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\python .\Documents\test.py

save the path to 

Add the path to your python installation in the Systeme varialbe Path (skip the ending python)

C:\Users\sjohanss\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\

also add 
C:\Users\sjohanss\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\Scripts
to the path. This will be needed for pip that will also be installed.

Write,
```
python --version
```
in the command editor to test if installation succeded.

Install pip by downloading https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py then run
```
python get-pip.py
```

Install virtual enviroments
```
pip install virtualenv
```

Activate the virtual enviroment
.\venv\Scripts\activate

Install from requirements.txt

### If everythin fails
A Binder-compatible repo with a `requirements.txt` file.

Access this Binder at the following URL 

http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/binder-examples/requirements/master


The base Binder image contains no extra dependencies, so be as
explicit as possible in defining the packages that you need. This includes
specifying explict versions wherever possible.

In this example we include the library `seaborn` which will be installed in
the environment, and our notebook uses it to plot a figure.
